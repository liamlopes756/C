# C Projects Repository

This repository is a curated collection of **academic exercises, studies, and small projects developed in C**, created throughout my Computer Science degree in PUC-SP and complementary learning paths.  
It focuses on reinforcing **core C programming fundamentals** through practical implementations and problem-solving challenges.

The projects were developed based on university coursework, structured programming courses, and independent practice to strengthen low-level programming skills.
